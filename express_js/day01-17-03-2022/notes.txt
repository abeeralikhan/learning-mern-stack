- Why do we use tools or packages?
    + Because, developers are lazy. When a problem is solved once, you don't solve it again and
    again. Instead, you use the solutions already provided to speed the development process
    of your app

- Why do we use "Express" framework?
    + Because, it's the most popular, loved, stable, and widespread backend framework in any 
    language

- When we goto an invalid endpoint, the express itself returns a 404 status. Which makes
our lifes easier when working with servers

- When we create a file named "server.js", then we directly use "npm start" without
explicitly mentioning it in the packages.json scripts, and it will work just fine

- What's the real power of express?
    + Routing

- How do we respont to a endpoint in express?
    + By using the app methods 
    + app.METHOD_NAME('<END-POINT>', Route_Handler);
    - For Example:
        app.get('/courses', (req, res) => {
            res.send('Hello World!');
        });

- What is the route handle?
    + Route handle is the function which is run against an endpoint
    + It always take request and response arguments 

- How do we send data to client's request?
    - By using the send method on the response arguement in the route handler callback
    - It will automatically set the content-type of the data,
    that's the beauty of expresss!

- How to make a parameterized route in express?
    - By using a colon (:), like as following:
        '/courses/:courseId'

- How to use arguements that are passed in a route?
    - const arg = request.params.argName;

- Can we send status code explicitly in express? Then how?
    - Yes, like following:
        + res.status(200).send('Hello World');
        + res.status(404).json({id: 0, name:'Abeer'});

- What are development dependencies?
    + These are dependencies that do not require to run the project
    + These are only used by developers while in the making of the application
    + The App is not directly depend on these

How to install dependencies as development dependencies?
    >> npm install PACKAGE_NAME --save-dev
