~ Section 1: A taste of React

- What is the main point of react?
    + To build components
    + They often make it easier to build modular applications

- What is a component?
    + Component = JavaScript logic + HTML + CSS

+ A react application containts a ton of components that are composed together

+ Goal: Separation of Concerns

+ React is a tool that helps us build reuable components

- What's the difference between a framework and a library?
    + Larger libraries are framework
    + You plug libraries into your code
    + Whereas, you plug your code into a frame 
    + Frameworks are "opiniated", "like you should do things in particular way for them to work"

- Is react a framework or a library?
    + When used on it's own, it's a "Library"
    + But, when used with other react tools such as react-router, webpack etc, its a "Framework"
    + The standard "React Ecosystem" is a framework

- Why react is not a framework?
    + Because it doesnt force you to do things out of the box

+ Components are the building blocks of react

+ You can pass data or methods to the components or between the components
