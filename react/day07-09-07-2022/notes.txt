        class Game extends React.Component {
            constructor(props) {
                super(props);
                this.state = {
                    score: 0,
                    playerName: 'Abeer Ali Khan'
                }
            }
            render() {
                return (
                    <div>
                        <h1>{ this.state.playerName } score is { this.state.score }</h1>
                    </div>
                );
