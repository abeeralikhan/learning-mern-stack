-- The Redirect Component

+ Client-side Redirect

+ We can mimic the behaavior of server-side redirects using react routers

- When to redirect?
    + Submits a form
    + Incase of 404 Error redirect user
    + And, so on!

+ Redirecting dynamically 

- There are two ways to implement client-side redirection:
    1) Using <Redirect to="[route]" /> Component
        + It's not a buttion
        + When anywhere in code this Component has run, you'll be redirect to the intended route

    2) Using history.push() method
        + This method is useful when you have to perfom some operations on users data before redirecting them to a route
        + Access this method using this.props.history.push("/food")

        + history object has a lot of other features such has goBack()
