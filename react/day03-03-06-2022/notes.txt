- What JSX stands for?
    + JavaScript Syntax Extension
    + JavaScript + XML

- What are the basic Rules of JSX?
    + An element must have a closing tag
    + If an element is self-closing, it must end with a '/'

+ JSX is more stricter then HTML

- Is it necessary to use JSX?
    + Not really, for returning a simple H1 tag you could use,
        React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello World!')

    + But, as number of tags increase, it will become messy!
    + So, JSX makes our life a whole lot easier.

- How we can embed JavaScript in JSX?
    + By, simply using curly braces ( {} )
    - We can write JavaScri(pt code inside these curly braces
        <h1> Count: { getCount() } </h1>

- Standard React App Layout
    1. Make separate .js files of all components
    2. Make a top-level file i.e App.js where you'll use your components, and this
        file will be rendered on the html
    3. Include new component files in the html before App.js
