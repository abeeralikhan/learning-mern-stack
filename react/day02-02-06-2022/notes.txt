+ React exist to help you make componets, have those components communicate, pass data,
pass information to one another

- What's the hardest part of react?
    + What to make a component
    + How many pieces you'll break it down into

+ Sometimes we reuse of our components, and sometimes we just make them and not reuse them

- Ways of creating a server:
    + Live server
    - Python server
        >> python -m http.server

- Why do we need a server to run react?
    + Because of Babel

- What is Babel used for?
    + It trasn-compiles the funcky looking html syntax (jsx) to javascript

- Ways of making a component:
    - Through, 
        + a class,
        + or, a function,

- What are the requirements of a class component?
    1. It must have a "render()" method
    2. And, it must return something

+ Historically: Function components --> dumb 

- We import JavaScript files in out html files signifying files type to be "text/jsx" 

+ We can only return a single tag by react component

- But, to return more than one tag, we use
    1. parenthesis '()'
    2. and encode them in another div
    Example:
        return {
            <div>
                <h1>My name is Abeer</h1>
                <h2>I'm 21 years old</h2>
            </div>
        }

- Difference between function components and class components:
    + Function used to be very simple
    + But, with the inroduction of Hooks, we can now write full-featured function components
