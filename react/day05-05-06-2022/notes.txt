- What are the two ways of styling htmls in React?
    - Through,
        1. CSS Classes
        2. Passing an object to inline style property of an element

- Why do we have to write className instead of class while styling?
    + Because, we are making html tags inside of JavaScript, and the keyword "class" 
    clashes with JS reserved for making classes i.e class. Therefore, we use className instead of 
    class in js.

- Do we name the class in css same as the component name?
    + Yes

- How to have different styles for different outputs? (win/lose)
    + By passing different objects to the inline style attribute based on certain conditions

~ Section 4: Introducing Create React App

- Why do we use "create react app"?
    + To initialize react projects
    + It gives us our app's foundational skeleton to work with
    + It initializes and configure all the files for us 

- Two main ways of using create-react-app:
    1. NPX (just use once) 
        >> npx create-react-app my_app

    2. NPM (install, then use)
        >> npm i -g create-react-app
        >> create-react-app my_app

- create-react-app structure:
    - public
        + index.html

    - src --> contains all of the components
        + App.jss
        + components...

- What is Webpack?
    + CRA is built on top of "Webpack"
    - Its a JS utility that:
        - Enables module importing/exporting
            + Packages up all CSS/Images/JS into a single file for browser
            + Dramatically reduces # of HTTP requests for performance
        + Hot Reloading: automatic reloading of the server once a file has been updated
        + Enables easy testing & deployment

- ECMA2015 Modules:
    + import './file' --> it imports someting from a file relative to your current file 
    + import 'file' --> it imports a package from the node_modules

- How do you export functions?
    + export {
        func1,
        func2,
        func3
    }

- What export default is used for?
    + To set a default export
    + If, you dont specify what you need, it will be exported
    + Note: You dont need curly braces to import defaults

- Explain "import React, { Component } from 'react';"
    + Here, "React" is the default export
    + Whereas, you're specifying a specific export i.e "Component" using object destructor 

- There are three Create React App Conventions that every React Developer must follow:
    1. Create separate files for components and file name should be same as the component name`
        Example:
            Car.js --> Car component
            Engine.js --> Engine component

    2. Components should always extend to the Component class (imported from 'react')
        And, your component should be the default export of the file

    3. Top level object, or entry point of your application should be the App.js file 

- CSS/assets conventions for create-react-app:
    1. Make CSS files for each component, keeping the file name as the component
        Example:
            Engine.js
            Engine.css

    2. Import css files at the top of every component file
    3. Apply css to the top level div of every element
        Example:
            return (
                <div className="Engine">
                    ........
                </div>
            );

    4. Store images in the src/ folder with the componets
        + Make a images folder to declutter the src/ folder
