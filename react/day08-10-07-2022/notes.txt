- What's the difference between super() and super()?
    + super() on it's own runs the constructor of it's parent class
    + super(props) runs the constructor of its parent class as well and pass props in it
    + The main difference is that with just super() you can this.props everywhere except for the class' constructor
    + To use this.props in the class' constructor you have to use super(props)

+ You never directly manipulate the states in react 

- How to change states in react?
    + There're many ways to manipulate states in react, 
    but one of the commonly used is "this.setState()" method.
    + this.setState() won't run either in constructor or render method
    + It accepts an object of the updated key value pair, and won't override the other values 
    already present in states

- How do we bind functions to click events in React?
    + <Button onClick={ this.toRun }></Button>

- What's the one problem while specifying "this" in html elements?
    + We have to bind the function calls first in the constructor for them to run
    + this.toRun = this.toRun.bind(this);

- The "State As Props" Design Pattern
    + This means that states of parent components are passed as props into the child components

+ Parents are often more stateful than their children
