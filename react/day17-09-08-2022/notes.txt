~ Section 17: React Lifecycle Methods

- Goals:
    1) Describe what component lifecycle is 
    2) Contrast methods for mounting, updating, unmouting
    3) Overview the less commonly used lifecycle methods

-- React Component Lifecycle

- Lifecycle Methods:
    - Are used to updated application state and reflect the changes to the UI before/after key react "events"
        + Here, events necessarly means DOM events

- The are three stages in the lifecycle of a react component:
    - Mounting
    - Updating
    - Unmounting

- The sequence in which things are executed in react  
    constructor --> render --> componentDidMount

1) Mounting
    + After, the constructor and render methods have ran once, componentDidMount is ran after them

    - componentDidMount:
        + This method runs after the component is mounted

        + "Mouting" is the first time the component is rendered to DOM

        + This is a good place to load any data via AJAX or set up subscriptions/timers

        - Runs only one time after the render() method
            + Render() method is ran more than once, but componentDidMount wont be called

        Note: You put setInterval() in the componentDidMount method, because you're gonna start it as soon as the page is loaded. NOT IN THE CONSTRUCTOR

    AJAX example: load data using axios.get(api)

- Why not load data in the constructor?
    + We would get the same result
    + But, It's in react docs to not set state inside the constructors
    + It's conventional to not set state in the constructor

+ It's recommend every time you fetch data, it should be in the componentDidMount method. There are some complicated issues
