+ HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language that tells web browsers how to
structure the web pages you visit

+ If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by
enclosing it in a paragraph (<p>) element

+ A block-level element appears on a new line following the content that precedes it

+ Inline elements are contained within block-level elements, and surround only small parts
of the document's content (not entire paragraphs or groupings of content).
An inline element will not cause a new line to appear in the document

+ Some elements consist of a single tag, which is typically used to insert/embed something
in the document

+ Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content

+ <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/" title="The Mozilla homepage" target="_blank">
A link to my favorite website.</a>

- Boolean attributes can only have one value which is generally the same as the attribute name
    + These are the attributes without values
    + <!-- using the disabled attribute prevents the end user from entering text
    into the input box --> <input type="text" disabled>

- Attributes without quotes
    + But only single attribute is allowed in this case
    + <a href=https://www.mozilla.org/>favorite website</a>

- Anatomy of an HTML document
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html> --> It is sometimes known as the root element
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>My test page</title> --> is also used to describe the page when it is bookmarked
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>This is my page</p>
    </body>
    </html>

+ In HTML, the characters <, >,",' and & are special characters. They are parts of the HTML
syntax itself. So how do you include one of these special characters in your text?
