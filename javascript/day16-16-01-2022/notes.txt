-inline events 
They are used just as attributes
e.g
elementObj.setAttribute('onclick', 'alert()');
elementObj.onclick = 'alert()'; // OR

-Drawback of inline events
JS code everywhere in html
Too much mess
Can not call multiple events on a single element

-ElementObj.addEventListener('even-name', <FUNCTION TO RUN>)
It's the most common and efficient way of adding events to our html elements
We can add multiple events to a single element using it

- addEventListener and THIS
The function which is binded to an element using addEventListener method, can access that element object inside it using the THIS keyword
