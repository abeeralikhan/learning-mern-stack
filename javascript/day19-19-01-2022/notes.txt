- Call Stack
The mechanism the JS interpreter uses to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions
HOW JS "knows" what functions is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc

- JS is single thread
All the code inside a script runs on a single thread
that means two different tasks cannot be performend on at the same time
for this to make possible, we implement asynchronous programming
