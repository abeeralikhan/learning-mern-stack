- Shorthand object properties
Used to assign same key as the variable name, and value should be what the varibale holds.
Example:
const tempInF = 100;
const tempInC = 34;
const avgTempInC = 20;
const maxTempInC = 41;
const minTempInC = -2;

const tempData = { tempInC, tempInFm avgTempInC, maxTempInC, minTempInC };
// Above holds same key name as the variable, and value of the variable without explicitly assigning

- Computed properties
If we want to set a dynamic key of an object, i.e we don't explicity write the key name, it will be deduced from a variables value.
const role = "Director";
const person = "Abeer Ali Khan";

const team = {
    role: person
    [role]: person
};
Output:
team --> {"role": "Abeer Ali Khan", "Director": "Abeer Ali Khan"}

- Object Methods
const info = {
    name: '',
    setName(name) {
        this.name = name
    }
}
