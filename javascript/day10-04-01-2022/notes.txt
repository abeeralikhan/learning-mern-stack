-Default parameters
    function power(n, m = 1) {
        let powered = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < m; i++)
            powered*=n;
        return powered;
    }

- Spread Operator
    It's used in three places 
    Function calls, Array literal, and Object literals

    1) In Function calls:
        Suppose a function accepts multiple arguements. Now, you have an array containing those arguement, how you'll pass them?
        One way is to use indexing. Another way is to use spread operator. 
        What spread operator does is it expands a list of elements into an array arguements. 
        Example:
        const nums = [1, 5, 10, 22, 44, 55, 66, 77, 99]
        Math.max(...nums) ==> Math.max(1, 5, 10, 22, 44, 55, 66, 77, 99)

    2) In Array Literals:
        We can use elements of other arrays to make an array by using spread. 
        Spread will basically expand all the elements of an array, and the outer array will catch it.
        const odds = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9];
        const even = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];
        const nums = [...odds, ...evens];

    3) In Object Literals:
        We can use properties of another object to make another object.
        const name = {fname: 'Abeer', mname: 'Ali', lname: 'Khan'};
        const education = {metric: 'The City Foundation', inter: 'Pakistan Shipowners Government College', uni: 'Usman Institute of Technology University'};
        const contact = {phone: '03131083726', email: 'khana963@gmail.com'};

        #Spreading into a single object
        const info = {...name, ...education, ...contact}
