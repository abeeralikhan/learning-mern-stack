-Introduction to DOM
What is it stands for? --> Document Object Model

The DOM is a javascript representation of a webpage

Just like you have "window" object that consist of JS's functions and variables etc
Same as, "document" is the object that consist of all the objects on a webpage
Which can be e.g all the tags, webpage specific methods, etc

All the objects are in the exact hierarchical order as in the webpage i.e body tag will be the parent tag,
ul/ol tags will be the parent tags of li, table tag will be parent tags all the td/tr tags, div tag will be 
the parent tag, and through it you can access its child tags

The point is, it makes it easier to access all the objects by following exact parent-child relation of all
the html tags. 

It also has some special properties for all the tags and they're specific to the tags

- Selecting HTML objects
(1) Select (2) Manupulate

- (1) Select
(1) getElementById() (2) getElementsByTagName() (3) getElementsByClassName()

- HtmlCollectionObject
When you select either by className or tagName. You get in return array like HtmlCollectionObject which is not an array.
It has some basic array properties like you can iterate over it using indexes
But, array methods won't be available on it e.g splice, indexOf, includes, reduce, filter etc
Note: We can convert it into an array by spreading into an array.

- querySelector & querySelectorAll
The DOM method querySelector is relatively a new method which selects elements by using CSS
We can write more specific statements using a querySelector
querySelectorAll selects multiple objects and returns NodeList Object, which is an array like object but it not an actual array

- (2) Manipulate

- innerText
Will return all the inner text of an element i.e not only the element's text, but all the text of its children
Suppose, you take the innerText of a body element. It will return all the text present on the entire page

- textContent
Same as innerText, but it's more faster. Because it retains the formatting an element's text i.e 
spaces, returns, tabs. 
It will also return text of hidden elements
