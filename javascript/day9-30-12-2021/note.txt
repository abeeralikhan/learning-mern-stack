-Reduce
It is an array method that accepts a callback function. It runs on every element of the array,
resulting in a single value.

Example:
[1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7].reduce((accumulator, currentVal) => accumulator + currentVal);

reduce(func, initializer);
where,
initializer = initial value of the accumulator (it can be an object)
